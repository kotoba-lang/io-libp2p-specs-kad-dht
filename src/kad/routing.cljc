  "**HTTP delegated routing** (specs.ipfs.tech/routing/http-routing-v1) — how
  something that is not a libp2p node reads and writes the real DHT.

  ## Read this before believing anything about decentralization

  A delegated router is an HTTP endpoint that *is* a DHT node and answers on
  your behalf. Using one means:

  - **the records are real.** A record published through `/routing/v1/ipns/…`
    is the same signed IPNS record, at the same DHT key, that any Kubo node
    would fetch. It is stored in the actual DHT and any peer can resolve it.
  - **you are not a DHT node.** You do not hold a routing table, you answer
    nobody's queries, and you see the network only through whichever endpoints
    you ask.

  So this is a genuine improvement over a single proprietary registry — the
  records become interoperable and the routers are replaceable, plural, and run
  by different people — and it is **not** the same thing as joining the DHT.
  Saying otherwise would be the kind of claim this workspace exists to avoid.
  What full participation still needs is named in the README: multiaddr, a TCP
  or QUIC transport, multistream-select, a stream muxer, and the
  `/ipfs/kad/1.0.0` RPC over it. `kad.message` and `kad.lookup` are already the
  protocol half of that; the transport is the gap.

  ## Why more than one router

  A single endpoint is a single point of failure and a single point of lying.
  `resolve` queries several concurrently-supplied routers and requires
  `quorum` agreeing valid records before it answers. One router that returns a
  stale-but-validly-signed record cannot win against two that return the
  current one, because `ipns.record/select` prefers the higher sequence number
  and the records are *validated by the caller* before they are counted.

  That is the property that makes this meaningfully different from asking one
  server: no single router is trusted, and the trust that remains is
  cryptographic rather than positional.

  ## Transport is injected

  `http-fn` is `(fn [{:keys [method url headers body]}] -> {:status :headers :body})`
  with `body` as octets (IPNS) or a parsed map (providers tests). No HTTP
  client and no JSON parser are imported: the caller owns the network, the
  timeouts, the TLS, and JSON. A library that owned them would be untestable
  without one.

  IPNS is a signed record (`get-ipns` / `resolve`). Providers are an index
  (`get-providers` / `find-providers`). Both are delegated routing. Neither
  makes this process a DHT node."
