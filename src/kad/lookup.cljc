  "The iterative Kademlia lookup, as a **pure state machine**.

  A lookup is the part of Kademlia that is genuinely subtle and the part that
  is normally impossible to test, because it is written as a loop around a
  network socket. Here it is `state + responses -> state + next-queries`, so a
  ten-round convergence over a simulated 10,000-peer network is an ordinary
  `reduce` and the concurrency is the caller's problem.

  ## The algorithm (Kademlia §2.3, as libp2p implements it)

  Keep a shortlist of the `k` closest peers known so far. Repeatedly send the
  query to up to `alpha` peers from the shortlist that have not been queried.
  Each response contributes `closerPeers`, which are merged into the shortlist.
  Stop when a full round produces nothing closer than what is already known and
  the `k` closest have all been queried.

  Three details that decide whether it converges or spins:

  **Progress is measured against the closest peer, not the shortlist.** A round
  that returns fifty new peers, none closer than the current best, is *no
  progress* — that is the termination condition. Measuring \"did the shortlist
  grow\" instead never terminates on a large network, because there is always
  another peer.

  **Failed peers are remembered as failed.** Otherwise the same unreachable
  peer is selected every round forever: it is never marked queried, so it stays
  eligible, and it is always among the closest.

  **`alpha` bounds concurrency, `k` bounds the answer.** Confusing them makes
  the lookup either serial (α=1) or a flood (α=k). libp2p uses α=3, k=20.

  ## Value lookups stop early, peer lookups do not

  A `GET_VALUE` for an IPNS name can stop as soon as it has enough valid
  records to satisfy the quorum — but *only* if the caller validated them.
  Stopping on the first record that parses lets any peer win a name by
  answering first, so `record!` takes already-validated records and the
  quorum is counted over those."
