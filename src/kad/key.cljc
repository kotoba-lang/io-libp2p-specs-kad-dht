(ns kad.key
  "Kademlia keyspace: the transformation from a record key to a DHT key, XOR
  distance, and the ordering everything else in Kademlia is built out of.

  Two byte strings are involved and conflating them is the classic bug:

  - the **record key** — the bytes a record is addressed by, e.g.
    `/ipns/<binary multihash>` (see `ipns.record/routing-key`)
  - the **DHT key** — `SHA-256(record key)`, a fixed 32 octets, which is what
    distance is measured on

  Peer IDs go through the same transform: a peer's position in the keyspace is
  `SHA-256(peer-id-bytes)`, not the peer ID itself. A node that measures
  distance on raw peer IDs computes a different topology from the rest of the
  network, and the failure is not an error — its lookups simply return the
  wrong peers and its records land where nobody queries.

  ## Why hashing at all

  Kademlia's guarantees depend on keys being uniformly distributed. Record keys
  are not: `/ipns/…` shares a six-octet prefix with every other IPNS key, so
  distance measured on them would pile every IPNS name into one corner of the
  keyspace. SHA-256 is what makes the space uniform, and it is why the
  transform is mandatory rather than an optimization."
