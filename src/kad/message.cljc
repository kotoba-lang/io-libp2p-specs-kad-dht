(ns kad.message
  "The `/ipfs/kad/1.0.0` wire message (libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht `pb/dht.proto`)
  and the libp2p `Record` it carries, as protobuf schemas over
  `protobuf.wire`.

  Field numbers here are the protocol, taken from the `.proto` that every
  implementation compiles. Two of them are worth pointing at because they read
  like mistakes and are not:

  - `key` is field **2**, after `type` (1), but `closerPeers` is **8** and
    `providerPeers` is **9** — the gap is where removed fields used to be, and
    renumbering to close it would break every peer.
  - `clusterLevelRaw` is field **10** despite being declared near the top of
    the `.proto`. Declaration order is not wire order.

  ## The Record is not the IPNS record

  A confusing overlap. libp2p's `Record` is the generic envelope the DHT stores
  — `{key, value, timeReceived}` — and for IPNS its `value` **is** a serialized
  `ipns.record` protobuf. Two nested protobufs, and mixing them up produces a
  record that is stored and never validates. `record-for` and `ipns-record-of`
  exist so no call site has to remember which layer it is holding."
